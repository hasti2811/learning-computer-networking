data on computers exist in the form of bits (1s and 0s), something has to be used to transport these bits between
hosts. this is where the physical layer comes in, the goal of the physical layer is transporting bits. 

anything that contributes to moving bits from computer to computer is known as layer 1 technology, examples
are: cables (ethernet, coaxial, fiber), wifi, repeaters, hubs, these cables take bits from one end and taking them to 
the other end.

the OSI model was written before the idea of wireless internet communication, so wifi is also considered as a layer one
technology because its purpose is to carry bits from one computer to the next
