the purpose of networking is to allow 2 hosts to share data, it allows us to send data through the wire:

computer------------computer


for hosts to send data automatically through the wire, they (hosts) must follow a set of rules, this is no different to
languages, each language has its own rules. networking has rules which are split into 7 different layers which is
known as the OSI model

7 - application layer
6 - presentation layer
5 - session layer
4 - transport layer
3 - network layer
2 - data link layer
1 - physical layer
