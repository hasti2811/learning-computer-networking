since MAC addresses handle data being hopped from one MAC address to another, how do we ensure that data gets sent from
the correct place to the correct destination? this is where layer 3 comes in, the network layer which ensures end to end
delivery

layer 3 uses IP addresses which are 32 bits and represented as 4 octets, each 0-255.

every host is going to be identified with its own IP address, this allows data to go from the source to the
destination

since routers enable this end to end delivery, they (routers) are layer 3 technology. hosts are also layer 3 devices but
anything really anything with an IP address can exit in layer 3

MAC addresses and IP address are independent functions, however there is a protocol which ties them together known as
ARP which will link a L3 address (IP address) to a L2 address (MAC address)
