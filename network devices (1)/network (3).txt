a network is a logical grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity and what transports traffic between
hosts (anytime 2+ hosts are connected, you have a network), example:

computer------------------computer

a regular network would be like a home, it has computer, phone, ipad etc.

networks can contain other networks, for example a school is network and it could have 6 classrooms and that all the
hosts in each classroom are grouped up in their own network. this networks within network are called
subnets (sub-networks).

networks can also connect to other networks, if I am at home and I want to access a classroom network, this is done by
having each network being connected to the internet, the internet is just a bunch of networks connected together
