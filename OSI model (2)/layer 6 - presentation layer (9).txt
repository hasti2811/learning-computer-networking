layer 6 tells us what to do with the bits (1s and 0s), lets say some data was sent to www.site.com. the data has arrived
to the web server, has arrived to the correct MAC address, IP address, port, and user session. now layer 6 tells us how
to interpret the bits.

there are multiple ways to interpret the bits such as splitting them into 6 bits each as base64 coding. this would mean
that each combination of 6 bits would turn into one base64 character.

we could also interpret them as 4 bits each which would mean each combination of 6 bits would turn into one hexadecimal
character.

we could also interpret them as 32/64 bits each, which would make each combination of 32/64 bits as one number.


modern example of layer 6:

HTTP as a protocol uses ASCII encoding, this groups the bits into sets of 8 bits and interprets each of those 8 bits as
a different ASCII character
