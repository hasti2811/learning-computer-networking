host - any device which sends or receives traffic. examples of hosts: computer, phone, laptop, server, printer, cloud
server etc.

hosts can either be clients or servers. clients initiate requests and servers respond. for example if a computer
is trying to visit google.com, the computer is the client and the web server is the server because its responding to the
request.

the web server may have to update its files from a file server so in this case the web server is the client and the
file server is the server

servers are computers with software installed which responds to specific requests.
