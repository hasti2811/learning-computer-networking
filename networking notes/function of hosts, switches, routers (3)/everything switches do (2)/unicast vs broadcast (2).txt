recap:

4 hosts (A:a1a1, B:b2b2, C:c3c3, D:d4d4) connected to switch, MAC address table empty, switch ports: A->5, B->7, C->8, D->9.
A send data to D, SRC a1a1 DST d4d4. A sends data through port 5, MAC address table: 5->a1a1. (action learn). then
action 2 flood (flood frame to all hosts connected to switch). when it arrive to D, D sends response to A. switch learns
D is on port 8. new MAC address table: 5->a1a1 8->d4d4.

end of recap.


in the above example, from A to D was a unicast frame because the destination MAC is another host (SRC a1a1 DST d4d4). 
a broadcast would look like: SRC a1a1 DST ffff. broadcast frame means the destination MAC address is ffff. this means
the frame gets sent to all hosts on the network. the first MAC address entry would have been the same if it was broadcast
because even though the frame gets sent to all hosts, the SRC is a1a1 and it goes through port 5. unicast frames are only
flooded when the destination MAC address is not in the MAC address table, if it is then there is no flooding. whereas with
broadcast, its always flooded
