LAN (local area network) - small area (home/office), connects multiple devices to share resources, providing internet
access in a small area

WAN (wide area network) - large area (city/country/continent), connects multiple LANs to enable communication and data
transfer over long distances

a computer network is a group of devices connected to each other allowing them to share information and recourses.

LAN (local area network) - a network that connects computers and devices within a limited geographical area such as: home,
office, school.

WAN (wide are network) - a network that covers a large geographical area often spanning cities, countries and even
continents. they are much larger than a LAN (they connect multiple LAN's together). They are generally slower than LANs
because of the long distances and many devices involved. they are managed by multiple organisations/telecom providers.
they enable communication and resource sharing across wide distances. the technology used are: fibre optic cables,
leased lines, satellites, 4G/5G etc.

importance in modern infrastructure:

- enables communication between devices
- critical for browsing and streaming
- backbone for data transfer and file sharing

when we use an application, our device sends data to a server over the network. the server processes this data and sends
back a response.

networking in devops:

- enables communication between servers (ssh into ec2 instance server etc)
- critical for launching and updating applications
- crucial in monitoring and managing infrastructure
- enhances troubleshooting, performance and scalability
