IP addresses are the identity of each host, just like you need a mailing address to receive mail, you need an IP
address to send and receive data

if a computer makes a request to visit google.com, it stamps the packet with a src IP (the client IP (the computer)) and
a dst IP (the server IP (the website server)). and when the server responds by providing the web page, it also stamps it
with the src IP (the server IP (the website server)) and the dst IP (the client IP (the computer))

ip addresses are 32 bits (bits = 1 or 0), so an IP address is just a different combination of 32 1s and 0s. we break the
32 bits and present them as 4 octets, then we convert each octet into a decimal number.

each octet can be from 0-255, example IP address: 136.22.17.98 --> each number can be from 0 to 255

IP addresses are typically hierarchically assigned, for example take ACME, inc. they own every IP address that begins
with 10.x.x.x and lets say they have 3 different offices (New York, London, Tokyo) and each office will have a subset of
the ACME, inc IP:

New York
10.20.x.x
(has everything that starts with 10.20.x.x)

London
10.30.x.x
(has everything that starts with 10.30.x.x)

Tokyo
10.40.x.x
(has everything that starts with 10.40.x.x)

each office may have different teams so now imagine this:

New York
10.20.x.x
sales: 10.20.55.x (has everything that starts with 10.20.55.x)
engineering: 10.20.66.x (has everything that starts with 10.20.66.x)
marketing: 10.20.77.x (has everything that starts with 10.20.77.x)

London
10.30.x.x
sales: 10.30.55.x (has everything that starts with 10.30.55.x)
engineering: 10.30.66.x (has everything that starts with 10.30.66.x)
marketing: 10.30.77.x (has everything that starts with 10.30.77.x)

Tokyo
10.40.x.x
sales: 10.40.55.x (has everything that starts with 10.40.55.x)
engineering: 10.40.66.x (has everything that starts with 10.40.66.x)
marketing: 10.40.77.x (has everything that starts with 10.40.77.x)


this hierarchy allows us to pinpoint where a specific host exist, if we had the IP 10.30.55.127, we'd know that its host
is at ACME, in London, in sales
