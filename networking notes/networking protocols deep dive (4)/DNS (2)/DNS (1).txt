we've mentioned that hosts are devices that send or receive traffic. and that hosts are either hosts or servers. we also
have said that servers are just computers with software that responds to specific requests.

- so an FTP server is just a computer with FTP software installed
- an SMTP server is just a computer with SMTP software installed
- a web server is just a computer with http/https software installed.

FTP server
84.68.31.41

SMTP server
john@gmail.com

Web server
http://site.com
https://site.com

client (host/computer)
9.1.1.11

so these clients and those servers (above 3 + etc) all follow the same rules of host to host communication, and for a host
to communicate to another host, it must know the other hosts IP address.

now the client can communicate with the FTP server because we can see its IP address (84.68.31.41), but how would that
client speak to the SMTP and web server? every time we browse a website, we write a domain name not an IP address.

to solve this we have a protocol known as DNS

DNS - domain name system, this converts domain names into IP addresses.

when you type a website into the browser, your computer is going to make a request to a DNS server which will ask for the
IP address of the website that you searched. then the DNS server will provide an IP address which will allow your host
to make a request to the actual web server using the IP address.

computer ----------|IP address for site.com?|----------> DNS server
DNS server ----------|site.com. 160.8.23.154|----------> computer

DNS server
8.8.8.8

the exact same process would happen for emails, the DNS would convert the domain (gmail.com) into an IP address, then
the host can communicate with the SMTP server.
