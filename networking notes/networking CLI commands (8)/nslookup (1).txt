nslookup - helps you look up DNS records which tell you how domain names map to IP addresses

nslookup amazon.com:
Server:         10.255.255.254
Address:        10.255.255.254#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   amazon.com
Address: 206.253.89.151

the server part shows the DNS server my computer used to perform the lookup, the address part is the same but it also shows
#53 which is the port, meaning it uses port 53 which is default for DNS.

the non authoritative answer part is the answer we got, the domain we queried was amazon.com, the corresponding IP address
is 206.253.89.151
