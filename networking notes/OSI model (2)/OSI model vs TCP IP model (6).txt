the TCP/IP model combines layer 1 and 2 of the OSI model and it is called the network access layer, then the next layer
is the internet layer which is just layer 3 of the OSI mode. then the next layer of the TCP/IP model is the host to host
layer which is just layer 4 of the OSI model. then the last layer of the TCP/IP model is the application layer which is
a combination of layers 5, 6 and 7 of the OSI model


OSI model:
7 - application layer
6 - presentation layer
5 - session layer
4 - transport layer
3 - network layer
2 - data link layer
1 - physical layer


TCP/IP model:
4 - application layer (layers 5, 6, and 7 of OSI model)
3 - host to host layer (layer 5 of OSI model)
2 - internet layer (layer 3 of OSI model)
1 - network access layer (layers 1 and 2 of OSI model)
