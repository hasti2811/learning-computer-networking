domain registrar is where you purchase domains, examples are AWS route53, godaddy, vercel domains, porkbun, cloudflare etc.

DNS hosting provider is the service that actually responds to queries for your domain, they store DNS records, when
someone types your domain into the browser, their computer asks your DNS host 'what IP is this domain at'.
