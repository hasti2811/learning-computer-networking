the OSI model was made before PC's, computing was done on massive machines called mainframes, humans accessed these
mainframes through dumb terminals which was just a monitor and a keyboard connected to the mainframes. these mainframes
were connected to other mainframes which also had their own set of users accessing through their own dumb terminals.

lets say we have 2 mainframes (A, B) that are connected to each other, and A has 3 users (blue, orange, yellow) and B has
2 users (blue2, green2), and blue from A is talking to blue2 on B the same time as green from A is talking to green2
on B, since both mainframes are doing all the computing, the packets will have the same MAC address and IP address. so how
will the data between the 2 blue users be kept separate from the 2 green users.

Layer 5 distinguishes between user sessions, it identifies a user independent from L2, L3 or L4 addresses

lets say there was a user on his phone connected to home wifi and he visits www.site.com. he would have to login etc.
then lets say he goes to a coffee shop and connects to that wifi. since there is a new IP address because there is a new
internet connection, the user would have to login again. since we are using HTTP to access this website, HTTP has a
feature called HTTP cookies (they are arbitrary text strings that store user-specific information) which are generated
by the server and given to the user when he first logs in. so now if he goes to a restaurant and uses their wifi and
logs in, the website would know its the user despite there being a new IP address because the cookie stays with the user.
