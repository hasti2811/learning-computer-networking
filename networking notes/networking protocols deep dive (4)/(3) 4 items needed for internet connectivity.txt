every host needs 4 items for internet connectivity:

- an IP address, this will serve as the hosts identity on the internet

- a subnet mask, this will tell the host the size of its network. this will allow the host to determine whether the IP
address its trying to speak to is on the same network or a foreign network. subnet masks can look either like
this: /24 or like this: 255.255.255.0.

if a host has only those 2 things, this is enough for the host to speak to any other host on the same network. but if this
host needs to speak to something on a foreign network such as the internet, a router is required.

- a router (default gateway), specifically the host needs the routers IP address which is the default gateway in order
to speak to foreign networks such as the internet and speak to any server (FTP, SMTP, Web server etc).

most of the time when you're on the internet, emails and website domain names are included, so the host cannot speak to
these servers with only those 3 things, it needs those 2 servers IP addresses (it can speak to the FTP server tho). this
is where the fourth requirement comes in which is a DNS server.

- DNS, this will convert domain names to IP address in order to communicate to servers such as web servers and SMTP servers.

IP: 9.1.1.1
SM: /24 | 255.255.255.0
DG (R): 9.1.1.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
