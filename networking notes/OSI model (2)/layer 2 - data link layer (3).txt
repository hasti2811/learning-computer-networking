layer 2 will interact with the physical layer, layer 2 puts bits on the wire and receives bits from the wire. whatever
the wire (that connects the 2 computers together) is connected to is considered to be as a layer 2 item. network
interface cards and wifi access cards are layer 2 items

layer 2's responsibility is to take bits from one NIC (network interface card) to the other NIC, which can be known as
hop to hop delivery. layer 2 uses MAC addresses to perform this.

MAC addresses are 48 bits, represented as 12 hex digits.
example MAC address: 94-65-9C-3B-8A-E5 (Windows) | 94:65-9C:3B:8A:E5 (Linux) | 9465.9C3B.8AE5 (Cisco)

every single NIC has a MAC address:
computer>-----------<computer (<> = NIC)

alongside NIC's, switches are also layer 2 devices

computer>-------|switch|-------<computer

if 4 computers (A, B, C, D) are connected to a switch, and A sends data to B, switches learn which MAC addresses 
are on which ports by examining the source address and destination address of incoming data. this allows A to send data
to only B

usually communication between hosts require multiple hops especially over long distances such as the internet, this means
we would have to jump across multiple routers to target hosts. each router is connected to a NIC and each NIC has its
own MAC address. layer 2 deals with sending the data from one MAC address to another MAC address and so on until it
reaches the hosts NIC. layer 2 handles the hop to hop delivery

since MAC addresses handle data being hopped from one MAC address to another, how do we ensure that data gets sent from
the correct place to the correct destination? this is where layer 3 comes in, the network layer which ensures end to end
delivery ----- go to layer 3 - network layer (4).txt
