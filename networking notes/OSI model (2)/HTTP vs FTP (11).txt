HTTP and FTP are both layer 7 protocols.

we've been using HTTP throughout these notes, for layer 5 we had HTTP cookies, for layer 6 we had ASCII and for layer 7
it had its own set of commands such as GET, POST, HEAD etc. but there is also other protocols such as FTP.

it doesn't make sense for FTP to use HTTP cookies in layer 5, FTP is free to choose how to implement layer 5 or to not
even implement it. FTP doesn't have a way to identify a user session without the layers below it. FTP uses layer 3 and 4
information to identify a user. so if you're using FTP to access a web server and your IP address changes, you'll have to
log back in. FTP can also use ASCII for layer 6, and for layer 7 it has its own commands such as GET, PUT, PASV, etc..
